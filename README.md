# Farkle

This is a sample Rails application.

The end goal is for it to serve an awesome version of the dice game [Farkle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farkle).

## Setup

To get this app up and running, there are only a few commands:
```rake db:create db:migrate```

Then, start the server with:
```rails server```

## Contributing

Well, you see, I'm making this for a job application, so I should really be the
only one working on it. If you really love it, we can talk about that after the
application process is over.
